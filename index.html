		<h2>Elon Musk needs tools to help the first Mars colonists travel to the surface of Mars.</h2>
		<p>Elon Musk is the founder and CEO of SpaceX. SpaceX designs, manufactures and launches advanced rockets and spacecraft. In September 2016 Elon Musk unveiled the company's Interplanetary Transport System (ITS). The most powerful rocket ever built. A spaceship designed to carry at least 100 people to the Red Planet per flight.</p>
		<h2>Problem Desciption</h2>
		<p>Its 2030. 103 people paid $200,000 each for a ticket to travel to Mars. Elon Musk asked The Hague University to help. The ITS is a beautiful spaceship, but still lacks some of the necessary information systems. Since JavaScript is a lightweight language its very suited for space travel. The plan is to create an Interplanetary Transport System Interface (ITSI).</p>
		<h2>Task</h2>
		<p>Design and create a website that is to be used inside the spacecraft. The purpose of the website is to give information about the trip and to prepare travelers for upcoming arrival on mars. You can incorporate some or all of the factors above and/or add your own ideas. Astronauts should be able to use the interface anywhere on the ship.</p>
